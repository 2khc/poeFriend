This is a fast program built for people who like to play the market on the video game Path of Exile. If you've found your way to this page then you probably already know that the way everything is handled by GGG right now is rather inefficient. Have the entire economy of a video game based on a free 3rd party solution is frankly quite shameful.

As such, this program uses the GGG public stash tab API directly and gives you direct stash tab updates so that you can pick up cheap deals before people who use poe.trade get their chance.

## Instructions
All you need to do is download the latest release, type in the name of an item you need want to monitor, fill in the rest of the fields and add the item to the list. The program will beep when and item is found and paste the trade message into your clipboard so that you can initiate a trade without needing to leave your game window.
